### Question 1
- 16000 bits
- 16000 bits
- The bandwidth-delay product is defined as the product of a network link’s capacity (in bits per second) and its end-to-end propagation delay (in seconds). It represents the maximum number of bits that can be "in flight" (on the wire) at any given instant. In other words, it’s the amount of data that can be transmitted into the network before the first bit reaches the receiver.
